# hadoop_food_ordering_system
This is for UCI CS230 Project

## Requirements:
* geopy library

## Setup:
In order to calculate drive time, we are using the Google Maps API.

To use this, you will need to a [Google Maps API KEY](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#enable-api-sdk "Google Maps API KEY").

Once you have your key, copy and paste into a text file, and place it anywhere on your computer.

Finally, in google_map_handler update `PATH_TO_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` to be path to the txt file that contains your key.

By Default it will look in the `food_ordering_system` directory.## Setup:
